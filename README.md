# 📝 Todo with MiniFramework

A Todo application built using a custom-engineered JavaScript framework. This project was created to explore the mechanics of Virtual DOM reconciliation, component lifecycles, and client-side routing without relying on external heavy-weight libraries.

## 🖼️ Project Walkthrough

### 🏠 Home View: The Clean Slate

### 💬 Task Management: Progress in Action
The application in use, showing a mix of active and completed tasks. Notice the custom SVG checkmarks and the "Items left" counter, which updates in real-time as the Diffing Algorithm patches the DOM.

### ✍️ Inline Editing: Direct Manipulation
A view of the "Active" filter with a task in Edit Mode. Triggered by a double-click, the editView logic swaps the label for a text input, allowing for immediate updates without leaving the page.
